# Claim Discipline Policy -- VSPL

All text published on vayasyaseva.com must adhere to this policy. Every claim falls into one of three categories, each with different requirements for evidence and review.

---

## 1. Claim Categories

### Category A: Directional Claims

**Definition:** Statements of capability intent -- what VSPL is set up to do, aims to do, or is structured to deliver. These express direction, not guaranteed outcomes.

**Evidence required:** Internal process documentation or operational capability.

**Language patterns:**
- "We are structured to..."
- "Our process is designed to..."
- "VSPL operates with the intent of..."
- "We aim to deliver..."

**Examples:**

| Acceptable | Not acceptable |
|------------|----------------|
| "Our deployment process is designed to place trained associates within 48 hours." | "We deploy associates in 48 hours, guaranteed." |
| "VSPL is structured to maintain full statutory compliance." | "VSPL guarantees 100% compliance at all times." |

---

### Category B: Measured Claims

**Definition:** Statements backed by a specific, verifiable metric -- a number, percentage, timeframe, or count.

**Evidence required:** Internal data source, third-party audit, or client-verifiable record. The data source and measurement period must be documented internally (not necessarily published, but available if challenged).

**Language patterns:**
- "As of [period], we have..."
- "[X] associates deployed across [Y] sites"
- "Compliance filing rate of [X]% in [period]"

**Examples:**

| Acceptable | Not acceptable |
|------------|----------------|
| "500+ associates deployed across 12 client sites as of Q4 2024." | "We have deployed thousands of workers everywhere." |
| "PF filing compliance rate of 99.2% for FY 2023-24." | "We have a perfect compliance record." |

**Update rule:** Measured claims must include a reference period. Any metric older than 12 months must be re-verified or removed.

---

### Category C: Contractual Claims

**Definition:** Statements about scope, commitments, or deliverables that mirror what VSPL actually contracts for. These are the strongest claims and carry the highest scrutiny.

**Evidence required:** Active contract language, SLA documentation, or signed service scope.

**Language patterns:**
- "Under our standard engagement, we provide..."
- "Our service scope includes..."
- "Contractual SLA of [X]"

**Examples:**

| Acceptable | Not acceptable |
|------------|----------------|
| "Our standard service scope includes PF, ESI, and wage register maintenance." | "We handle all your HR compliance, end to end." |
| "Replacement workforce deployed within SLA-defined timeframes per contract." | "Instant replacement guaranteed, no questions asked." |

## 2. Prohibited Language

The following words and phrases are **never** to be used in website copy:

| Word/Phrase | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| "best" | Unqualified superlative. Invites challenge. |
| "world-class" | Meaningless without a defined standard. |
| "seamless" | Nothing involving workforce operations is seamless. Overpromises. |
| "revolutionary" | VSPL is process-driven, not disruptive. Mispositions the brand. |
| "guaranteed" (unqualified) | Only use if backed by a contractual SLA with defined remedy. |
| "100%" (unqualified) | Only use if backed by audited data for a specific period. |
| "leading" / "No. 1" | Requires third-party ranking evidence. |
| "hassle-free" | Subjective and overpromising. |
| "one-stop" | Vague and overused. Describe specific capabilities instead. |

---

## 3. Review Process

### Before publishing any new page or content update:

1. **Categorize every claim.** Tag each statement as Directional (A), Measured (B), or Contractual (C).
2. **Verify evidence.** For Category B and C claims, confirm the evidence source exists and is current.
3. **Check prohibited words.** Search the content for any word from the prohibited list above.
4. **Read aloud.** If a sentence sounds like it belongs in a sales pitch rather than an operations brief, rewrite it.
5. **Brand owner sign-off.** Final approval per `docs/content-approval-workflow.md`.

### Quarterly review

- All measured claims (Category B) must be reviewed quarterly.
- Stale metrics (no refresh in 12 months) must be removed or updated.
- The review is logged with date and reviewer name.

## 4. Good vs. Bad Claim Examples

| Bad | Problem | Good |
|-----|---------|------|
| "VSPL is the best manpower company in Uttarakhand." | Unqualified superlative, no ranking evidence. | "VSPL is a registered workforce operations partner operating in the Haridwar-SIDCUL industrial corridor." |
| "We provide seamless end-to-end HR solutions." | "Seamless" is prohibited; "end-to-end" is vague. | "Our service scope covers recruitment, deployment, statutory compliance (PF/ESI), and attendance management." |
| "100% client satisfaction guaranteed." | Unverifiable, unqualified guarantee. | "We maintain ongoing client relationships with defined SLAs and periodic performance reviews." |
| "World-class workforce management." | "World-class" is prohibited and meaningless. | "Process-driven workforce management aligned to client SOPs and statutory requirements." |
| "Instant deployment of workers." | "Instant" is unrealistic and sets wrong expectations. | "Our deployment process is designed to place trained associates within contracted SLA timelines." |

## 5. Enforcement

- Any content that violates this policy must be corrected before deployment.
- If a claim cannot be categorized or evidenced, it is removed -- not softened.
- This policy applies to all website copy, meta descriptions, Open Graph text, and alt text.
